Course description 
======
This course is taught to applied mathematics engineers at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/cours-2025-linma2415) and can be viewed as the course of operations research applied to electricity markets. Besides being the teaching assistant for two years, I was also asked to teach two of the semester’s lectures.
The workload implied 2h of exercise session per week with about 30 graduate students as well as the writing of the assignment for the project of the course and the correction of the students’ works (1/4 of the course grade).
